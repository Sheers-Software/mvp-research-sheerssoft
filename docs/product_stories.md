# Product & User Story Breakdown
**Source:** Analysis of live website `https://sheerssoft.com/` (February 2026)

## 1. Product Distribution & Consumption Model

### How is the product distributed? (The "Get" Flow)
**Model:** Managed SaaS with Concierge Onboarding (High-Touch Pilot)
The product is not self-serve immediate access. Instead, it uses a "Start Free Pilot" distribution mechanism to lower the barrier to entry for non-technical hoteliers.

*   **Entry Point:** The comprehensive "Start Free Pilot" CTA on every page.
*   **Mechanism:** A 2-step intake form collecting role and contact info.
*   **Fulfilment:** "Live in 48 hours." The Nocturn team handles the technical setup (Knowledge Base creation, channel integration) on behalf of the user. This removes the "setup friction" user story ("I don't have time to configure a bot").

### How is the product consumed? (The "Use" Flow)
**Mode 1: Passive Revenue Recovery (The "Peace of Mind" Engine)**
*   **User:** Hotel Owner / GM
*   **Action:** Does nothing active. The AI runs 24/7 on WhatsApp/Web.
*   **Consumption:** Receives "Daily Revenue Reports" (via email or dashboard) showing captured inquiries and saved revenue.
*   **Value:** "I woke up and saw we saved RM 3,000 in bookings while I slept."

**Mode 2: Active Sales Intervention (The "Supercharger")**
*   **User:** Reservation Manager / Sales Team
*   **Action:** Logs into the "Multi-channel Dashboard".
*   **Consumption:** Reviews conversations flagged by AI as "High Value" or "Complex."
*   **Value:** "I don't waste time on FAQ. I only talk to the guest who wants to book 30 rooms for a wedding."
