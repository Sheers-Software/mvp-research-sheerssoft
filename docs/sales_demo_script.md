## 1. The Opening (The Dashboard)
*Open the main dashboard page.*

> "This is your Mission Control. Right now, Nocturn AI is monitoring your WhatsApp, Email, and Website 24/7."

**Point at**:
1.  **Revenue Recovered**: "This RM [Amount] figure isn't just a number—it represents bookings you would have likely lost because staff were busy or offline."
2.  **After-Hours Activity**: "Notice how much activity happens after 10 PM? That's your 'Ghost Shift' where money is usually left on the table."

## 2. The Solution (Live Demo)
*Open a WhatsApp simulator or actual phone window side-by-side.*

> "Let's see it in action. Imagine I'm a guest at 11:30 PM."

**Action**: Send: *"Hi, I'm looking for a venue for my wedding next year."*
**Observe**:
1.  Instant response (check speed).
2.  Contextual question ("How many guests?").
3.  **Bilingual Check**: Switch to Manglish. *"Maybe around 150 pax. Got package ah?"*
4.  **Result**: "See how it didn't break? It understood the local context immediately."

## 3. The Value (Lead Capture)
*Navigate to the **Leads** tab.*

> "While we were chatting, the AI was working in the background."

**Show**:
1.  **Sarah Lee (High Value)**: "It flagged this as 'High Value' because of the wedding keyword."
2.  **Structured Data**: "It didn't just dump a chat log. It extracted the Name, Pax Count, and Date."
3.  **Action**: "Your sales team doesn't need to read 50 messages. They just call Sarah."

## 4. The Safety Net (Handoffs)
*Navigate to **Conversations** -> Filter by **Action Required**.*

> "What if a guest is angry? The AI knows when to step back."

**Show**:
1.  **The Complaint**: Show the 'Aircond' complaint example.
2.  **The Alert**: "It stopped replying and flagged this for your Duty Manager immediately."
3.  **Daily Email**: Briefly mention the "Action Required" email alert.

## 5. Closing
> "Nocturn AI isn't a chatbot. It's a revenue recovery engine that speaks your guest's language and works while you sleep."
