# Revenue Estimation Methodology

## Overview
This document outlines the formula used by Nocturn AI to calculate the **"Estimated Revenue Recovered"** metric displayed on the dashboard and in daily performance emails.

The goal of this metric is to provide a conservative, credible estimate of the value generated by the AI, rather than a raw potential value that may overstate impact.

## The Formula

The estimated revenue is calculated as follows:

```
Estimated Revenue = (Sum of High-Intent Leads Value) × (Conversion Rate)
```

Where:

1.  **High-Intent Leads Value**: The sum of potential booking value for all leads captured by the AI.
    *   **Value Calculation**: `(Number of Nights * Property ADR)`
    *   If the number of nights is unknown, it defaults to **1 night**.
    *   **ADR (Average Daily Rate)**: Defined in the property settings (default RM 230).

2.  **Conversion Rate**: The estimated percentage of leads that convert into actual paid bookings.
    *   **Default**: **20%** (Conservative industry standard for qualified leads).
    *   *Note: This effectively discounts the "total pipeline value" by 80% to account for cancellations, no-shows, and leads that do not book.*

## Example Calculation

**Scenario**:
*   Property ADR: RM 250
*   AI captures **10 leads** in a day.
*   Total Pipeline Value: 10 leads * RM 250 = RM 2,500.

**Dashboard Metric**:
*   `RM 2,500 × 20% = RM 500`

## Transparency
This formula is transparently disclosed on:
1.  **Dashboard**: Tooltip on the "Est. Revenue" card.
2.  **Daily Email**: Footnote under the revenue section.
3.  **Marketing Website**: ROI Calculator uses identical logic.

## Future Refinements
In future updates (Sprint 3-4), this static 20% rate will be replaced by a dynamic, property-specific conversion rate based on actual "Booking Confirmed" data logged by the hotel staff.
